// A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.
// Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes.There’s practically no difference between them in JavaScript.
// Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes.They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${… }
let name = "John";

// embed a variable
alert(`Hello, ${name}!`); // Hello, John!

// ` ` - have embedding functionality

//No character type in JS, There’s only one type: string. A string may consist of zero characters (be empty), one character or many of them.
