// The 3rd way to declare functions is through the arrow way


// let func = (arg1, arg2, ..., argN) => expression;

//they can also be dynamically used to create functions just like function expression method and easier to create anonymous functions i.e functions which are only limited to a code block.

//if we are writing a function body we can enclose it within curly braces and curly braces require an explicit return within them to return them.
