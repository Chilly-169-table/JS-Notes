// Although they are called “logical”, they can be applied to values of any type, not only boolean.Their result can also be of any type.

// ||(OR) operator - returns first TRUTHY or TRUE value, if all are false returns last value.
// A value is returned in its original form, without the conversion.


//&&(AND) operator - finds the first FALSY value, if all are true returns last value. 
// / A value is returned in its original form, without the conversion.

// !NOT operator - The operator accepts a single argument and does the following:

// Converts the operand to boolean type: true / false.
// Returns the inverse value.

//A double NOT !! is sometimes used for converting a value to boolean type:


// Nullish coalescing operator '??'
//The result of a ?? b is:
//defined is something which is neither null nor undefined values
// if a is defined, then a,
// if a isn’t defined, then b.
// In other words, ?? returns the first argument if it’s not null / undefined.Otherwise, the second one.
