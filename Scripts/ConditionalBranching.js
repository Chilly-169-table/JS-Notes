// if, ?
//if() converts the condition or expression inside brackets into boolean and evaluates it if it is true else skips it
//ternary operator can be used when a condition needs to be checked just like in if operator and value also needs to be assigned.
//let result = (condition) ? value1 : value2; 

//value1 is returned to result if condition evaluates to true, else value2 is returned.
