// Unary - If the Operator only has single operand For Ex: Unary negation - reverses sign of the number
//binary - If the Operator has two operands.

// Maths

// The following math operations are supported:

// Addition +,
//     Subtraction -,
//     Multiplication *,
//     Division /,
//     Remainder %,
//     Exponentiation **.
// The first four are straightforward

//if the binary + is applied to strings, it merges (concatenates) them:

//The unary plus or, in other words, the plus operator + applied to a single value, doesn’t do anything to numbers. But if the operand is not a number, the unary plus converts it into a number.

//Assignment Operator = 


//Bitwise operators

// Bitwise operators treat arguments as 32 - bit integer numbers and work on the level of their binary representation.

// These operators are not JavaScript - specific.They are supported in most programming languages.

// The list of operators:

// AND( & )
// OR( | )
// XOR( ^ )
// NOT(~ )
// LEFT SHIFT( << )
// RIGHT SHIFT( >> )
// ZERO - FILL RIGHT SHIFT( >>> )

//The comma operator allows us to evaluate several expressions, dividing them with a comma ,. Each of them is evaluated but only the result of the last one is returned. ,

//Increment/decrement operator ++ and --

//Increment/decrement can only be applied to variables. Trying to use it on a value like 5++ will give an error.

//When the operator goes after the variable, it is in “postfix form”: counter++. - Increments the value but returns the old value
// The “prefix form” is when the operator goes before the variable: ++counter.   - Increments and the returns the new value
