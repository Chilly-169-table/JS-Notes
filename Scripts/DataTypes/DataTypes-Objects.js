//The Only Non-Primitive Data type in JS, rest all are primitive meaning
// All other types are called “primitive” because their values can contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever).
//  In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.


//Functions also belong to the Object-Data type
