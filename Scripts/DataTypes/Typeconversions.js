// operators and functions automatically convert the values given to them to the right type
//For Ex :- alert automatically converts any value to a string to show it.Mathematical operations convert values to numbers.

//String Conversion
//Use the keyword String(value) - to convert any value which belongs to other Data type to String.

//Numeric Conversion
//Number(value) - to convert any value which belongs to other data type to Number.
// whenever Mathematical opeartors are invovled the operands are automatically converted to Number Data type.
//In case of Non-valid conversion NaN is returned.

//Some examples of Value conversions
//undefined becomes NaN
//null becomes 0
//true and false becomes 1 and 0
//string becomes (whitespaces are removed first, if remaining string is empty 0 is returned, else number is read from the String. An failed conversion returns NaN)

//Boolean conversions
//Happens in logical Operations
//can be done expicility with Boolean(value) 
//Values that are intuitively “empty”, like 0, an empty string, null, undefined, and NaN, become false.
// Other values become true.
//any Non-empty string is true in JS, even if it includes 0 or whitespaces.
