# JS-Notes

This is a repo I created while learning JS, while i'm writing this READ-Me my learning is still in progress.
The Primary resource for my JS learning is Javascript.info due to which you'll find that everything almost co-releates to the exact information and code-snippets on JS.info
I have further divided the topics present there into various sub-topics for better understanding. I know it's cumbersome but my learning somehow ended up that way.
You can find the code and explanations on each topic under it's respective file
There are also some tasks present for most of the topics in JS.info which i have included in few of the files. 
And on the outside there is a basic.html which you can use to run any file present under Scripts Folder. just open basic.html and edit the <script> tag with changing the src attribute i.e<script src="scripts/your-desired-file_name.js> which will make the desired JS file run in the browser.


Any Contributions,Changes or recommendations that would help me in learning JS better, send them my way.
You can ping me anytime or shoot an email!
